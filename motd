<h1>WELCOME TO THE REALM OF THE BERRIES!</h1>
<h4>RotB is a Team-Deathmatch dedicated server, so make sure you check these brief rules before spawning!</h4>
<p>
1) This server is a dedicated melee Team Deathmatch arena. Therefore, ranged weapons have been mostly banned, the only exception are melee weapons whose "alt mode" causes them to be thrown (e.g. Axe)</p>
<p>2) Griefing is not allowed. Bear traps, area-denial tools (bombs) and the toolbox have been disabled.</p>
<p>3) Spawn-Camping is not allowed.</p> 
<p>4) Team harassment is not permitted. The server may automatically kick a player who has reached a certain number of teamkills.</p>
<p>5) Toxicity, in any form, is not permitted. Pettiness has no place here.</p>
