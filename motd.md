# WELCOME TO THE REALM OF THE BERRIES!
#### RotB is a Team-Deathmatch dedicated server, so make sure you check these brief rules before spawning!
1. This server is a dedicated melee Team Deathmatch arena. Therefore, ranged weapons have been mostly banned, the only exception are melee weapons whose "alt mode" causes them to be thrown (e.g. Axe)
2. Griefing is not allowed. Bear traps, area-denial tools (bombs) and the toolbox have been disabled.
3. Spawn-Camping is not allowed.
4. Team harassment is not permitted. The server may automatically kick a player who has reached a certain number of teamkills.
5. Toxicity, in any form, is not permitted. Pettiness has no place here.
#### Have fun! *- The Berries*
